Tonometer test reading results on linux:
- install  mdbtools to run mdb-sql command line utility
- two key db tables in ora.mdb (MS Access db): Measures, Patients
- eg.
 echo "Select * from Measures" | mdb-sql -p -d '","' ora.mdb
 - dumps the entire table with first row as header and all
  records as subsequent EOL terminated strings
 - strings remain to be double quoated head and tail but
 internal fields are delimited by ","
