https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=sql-server-ver15

Setting up Qt from online installer and initializing sql drivers
- go to install root of Qt
- go to ~/Qt/5.15.2/Src/qtbase/src/plugins/sqldrivers
- if present del config.cache
- run qmake
- the list of drivers that can be build is listed, add any
dev lib dependencies such as odbc or mysql as re required and repeat
remove cache and run qmake
- run sudo make and sudo make install

CDTT test reading results on linux:
- install command line utility xlsx2csv
- run on xlsx file to dump each sheet to csv
- xlsx2csv -q 'all' -n "Main" -i RESULT_FILE-XXXXXXX.xlsx results_part_1.csv
- xlsx2csv -q 'all' -n "EN_CA-Male" -i RESULT_FILE-XXXXXXX.xlsx results_part_2.csv
- parse csv as required

Tonometer test reading results on linux:
- install  mdbtools to run mdb-sql command line utility
- two key db tables in ora.mdb (MS Access db): Measures, Patients
- eg.
 echo "Select * from Measures" | mdb-sql -p -d '","' ora.mdb
 - dumps the entire table with first row as header and all
  records as subsequent EOL terminated strings
 - strings remain to be double quoated head and tail but
 internal fields are delimited by ","

Qt with ODBC on linux currently does not work correctly


QtUsb library 
- fully functional github repo tested on Ubuntu 20.04 Ias of 20220114 
- git clone https://github.com/fpoussin/QtUsb
- for linux run non-distro qmake install of Qt (Qt src and pre-build installed using Maintenance tool)
- in build dir: 
  qmake path_to_qtusb_source
  make
  sudo make install
- install includes and libs are then readily available in Qt Creator
- in .pro file add usb lib (eg., QT += usb)
- header files are prefixed (eg., #include <QtUsb/QUsb>)

Win 7 build of QtUsb

- git clone into C:\files\repository
- install perl using 32 bit msi installer from https://strawberryperl.com/
- check perl is installed: open win command prompt: perl -v
- cd C:\files\repository\QtUsb
- build_msvc.bat 2019 x64 static C:\Qt\5.15.2\msvc2019_x64
